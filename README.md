# OTP-Input-System
This OTP (One-Time Password) input system is a secure interface for verifying user identity. It features a four-digit OTP input, allowing users to enter and edit each digit. The system includes automatic submission when all digits are entered, a timer preventing rapid resubmission, and a "Resend OTP" option when the timer expires. For incorrect OTPs, an error state triggers a subtle shake animation as feedback. The interface is user-friendly, with all elements aligned and centered for a clean, focused experience. Ideal for implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) or verifying user actions in web applications.
